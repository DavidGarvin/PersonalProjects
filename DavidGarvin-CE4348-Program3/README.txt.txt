If no file names given, will default to q.txt, a.txt, and availvec.txt

Resource vector not needed on input.

You can give your own file names in that order.

The files in MoreTestData are slightly different problems sets.
I wrote them to test the ability to add filenames to the command line arguments.

I tested it by writing the files in Windows and moving them to Linux.
They work that way. If you write them in Linux they don't seem to work.

I REPEAT THE TXT FILES HAVE TO BE WRITTEN IN WINDOWS AND THEN PASSED TO LINUX.
